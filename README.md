# Features
* Run Kusto Queries
* Graphs & Data Viewer
* Code Completion
* Syntax highlighting
* Code refactoring
* Code formatting
* Kusto panel with access to Clusters, Databases, Tables, etc
* Run Kusto queries in Plain text files, Notebooks or in an Interactive Window

# Getting Started
* Open a `*.kql|*.csl` file and start typing to get code completion.
* Open a `*.kql|*.csl` file and click on the `Run Query` code lense
* Open a `*.kql|*.csl` file as a notebook
* Create a file with extension `*.knb` (or use the command `Create Kusto Notebook`)
* Use the command `Configure Kusto Connection` to configure the Kusto connection.

# Works with Jupyter Notebooks as well (when using [kqlmagic](https://pypi.org/project/Kqlmagic/))
* This extension augments Jupyter Notebooks with Kusto language features, when using the [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) extension.
* The extension will automatically detect the cluster and database from cells containing the connection information `kql AzureDataExplorer://code;cluster='help';database='Samples'`.

# Difference between Kusto Notebooks & Jupyter Notebooks  (with [kqlmagic](https://pypi.org/project/Kqlmagic/))
* Kusto Notebooks, there are no additional dependencies.
    * Authentication against Azure is handled by VS Code.
* With Jupyter Notebooks, you'll need to install Python and the [kqlmagic](https://pypi.org/project/Kqlmagic/) package.
    * You can use Python to further analyze the data.

# Roadmap
* Support for more charts
* & more...
